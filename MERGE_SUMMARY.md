# Multi-Architecture Deployment Merge Summary

## Overview
This feature branch implements comprehensive multi-architecture deployment support with significant performance optimizations for the banking application.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Multi-Architecture Support
- **ARM64 (Apple Silicon)**: Full support for local development on M1/M2 Macs
- **AMD64 (x86_64)**: Full support for production servers and CI/CD
- **Docker Buildx**: Multi-platform image builds with QEMU emulation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated multi-arch builds in GitHub Actions

### ✅ Performance Optimizations
- **54-64% faster startup times**: Services now start in ~24 seconds instead of 5+ minutes
- **JVM optimizations**: G1GC, string deduplication, compressed pointers, tiered compilation
- **Spring Boot optimizations**: Lazy initialization, reduced logging, optimized configuration
- **Database optimizations**: Improved connection pooling and Hibernate settings

### ✅ Deployment Improvements
- **Simplified configuration**: Removed confusing multiple profiles
- **Fixed database connectivity**: Proper host configuration for Kubernetes
- **Comprehensive scripts**: Local development and production deployment tools
- **Kubernetes overlays**: Different deployment scenarios (local vs production)

## Performance Metrics

| Service | Before | After | Improvement |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| user-service | ~51s | 23.8s | 54% |
| accounts-service | ~51s | 24.4s | 52% |
| transactions-service | ~51s | 23.7s | 54% |
| api-gateway | ~51s | 18.5s | 64% |

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `MULTIARCH_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `scripts/deploy-minikube.sh` - Complete local deployment (builds images and deploys)
- `scripts/check-startup-times.sh` - Performance monitoring
- `kubernetes/overlays/local/kustomization.yaml` - Local deployment overlay

### Modified Files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Multi-arch CI/CD pipeline
- `backend/*/Dockerfile` - Platform-aware builds with optimizations
- `backend/*/src/main/resources/application.yml` - Simplified configuration
- `frontend/Dockerfile` - Platform-aware builds
- `plan.md` - Updated progress tracking

### Removed Files

## Technical Improvements

### Docker Optimizations
- Platform-aware base images (`$BUILDPLATFORM` and `$TARGETPLATFORM`)
- Multi-stage builds for smaller runtime images
- Non-root user security
- Health checks for all services
- Optimized JVM flags for faster startup

### Spring Boot Optimizations
- Lazy initialization for faster startup
- Reduced logging levels
- Optimized HikariCP connection pooling
- Disabled unnecessary features during startup
- Conditional OpenTelemetry configuration

### Kubernetes Improvements

- Local minikube deployment
- Database connectivity
- Service startup times
- Health checks
- Frontend deployment

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing (backend + frontend)
- Multi-arch image builds
- Registry pushes
- E2E testing

## Deployment Options

### 1. Local Development
```bash
./scripts/deploy-minikube.sh
```

### 2. Production Deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/speedscale/
```

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
