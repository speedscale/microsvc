# Banking Application Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create monorepo structure with backend services, frontend, and infrastructure directories
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL with separate schemas for each microservice
- [x] Configure Docker Compose environment with logging and health checks

## Phase 2: Backend Services Development âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Implement Spring Boot microservices (user, accounts, transactions, api-gateway)
- [x] Add JWT authentication, database persistence, and initial OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suites with >80% code coverage

## Phase 3: Frontend Development âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Build Next.js frontend with TypeScript and authentication context
- [x] Implement responsive UI components for all banking operations
- [x] Integrate with backend APIs using comprehensive error handling

## Phase 4: Testing âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Complete backend testing suite (unit, integration, API tests)
- [x] Frontend testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright E2E tests
- [x] Achieve >80% test coverage across all services
- [x] **API Route Testing with Proxymock**: Set up proxymock server with predefined responses for all API endpoints to enable direct testing of Next.js API routes without database dependencies
- [x] **Backend Test Fixes**: Resolved JWT configuration issues in accounts-service by removing OAuth2 resource server configuration and using consistent custom JWT filter approach across all services

## Phase 5: Observability & Monitoring âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Deploy and configure a robust OpenTelemetry instrumentation across all services
- [x] Set up Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana monitoring stack
- [x] Configure and verify distributed tracing and custom business metrics

## Phase 6: Containerization âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds and security hardening
- [x] Refactor API endpoints for consistent resource-based structure
- [x] Validate containerized environment with comprehensive integration testing

## Phase 7: Kubernetes Development & Testing âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create production-ready Kubernetes manifests with RBAC, ConfigMaps, and Secrets
- [x] Deploy and debug full stack on minikube with automated scripts
- [x] Build comprehensive E2E test client validating core authentication workflows

## Phase 8: CI/CD Pipeline & Production Readiness âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions for automated building and testing with multi-architecture Docker images (ARM/AMD)
- [x] Configure Docker image registry with proper tagging, versioning, and optimize Spring Boot startup times
- [x] Simplify API Gateway routing architecture by eliminating complex path rewriting and implementing transparent proxy pattern

## Phase 9: Security Hardening & Production Readiness âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Version management with semantic versioning (v1.1.0+)
- [x] OpenTelemetry tracing fixed across all services including frontend
- [x] API Gateway security with proper authentication
- [x] Actuator/prometheus endpoint filtering in OTEL
- [x] Fixed 401 errors in registration and transaction flows
- [x] **OpenTelemetry Pure Implementation**: Disabled Speedscale injection and confirmed pure OpenTelemetry HTTP/DB instrumentation working across all services
- [x] **Trace Filtering**: Configured OTel collector to filter health check spans (/actuator/health, /actuator/prometheus) and security filter chain noise
- [x] **Service Configuration**: Standardized OTel configuration across user-service, accounts-service, and transactions-service
- [x] **Clean Observability**: Achieved clean traces showing only business transactions with proper HTTP and database spans

### ðŸ”§ Optional Enhancements (Not Critical for Demo)

#### Testing & Validation
- [x] **Create Playwright E2E test script** - Automated user journey testing
  - [x] Write `tests/e2e/user-journey.spec.ts` to visit all frontend pages
  - [x] Add npm script: `npm run test:e2e` to run Playwright tests
  - [x] Add Makefile targets: `make test-e2e`, `make test-e2e-ui`, `make test-e2e-debug`
  - [ ] Include in CI/CD pipeline for automated regression testing

#### Observability Fine-Tuning (Optional)
- [ ] Fine-tune remaining health check span filtering for accounts-service
- [ ] Add custom business metrics (login success rate, transaction volume)
- [ ] Configure Grafana dashboards for business KPIs

#### Security Enhancements (Production-Ready Features)
- [ ] **Service-to-Service Authentication** - Secure inter-service communication
- [ ] **CORS Hardening** - Replace wildcard origins with allowed domain list
- [ ] **Rate Limiting** - Implement at API Gateway (e.g., 100 req/min per user)
- [ ] **JWT Improvements** - Add refresh tokens, rotation, secure storage
- [ ] **Security Headers** - HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- [ ] **Input Validation** - Comprehensive sanitization on all endpoints
- [ ] **Audit Logging** - Track security events and access patterns

## Phase 10: Production Kubernetes Deployment
- [ ] Deploy application to production Kubernetes cluster with registry images
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS, load balancing, and ingress controllers
- [ ] Set up production monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery

## Phase 11: Documentation & Security Audit
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation and developer guides
- [ ] Complete security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Finalize code quality standards and coverage analysis
- [ ] Clean up any unused scripts

## Phase 12: Advanced Features & Optimization
- [ ] Implement enhanced banking features (account types, transaction categories)
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (caching, database tuning)
- [ ] Create advanced reporting and analytics capabilities

## Phase 13: Comprehensive System Testing
