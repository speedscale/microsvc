# Banking Application Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create monorepo structure with backend services, frontend, and infrastructure directories
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL with separate schemas for each microservice
- [x] Configure Docker Compose environment with logging and health checks

## Phase 2: Backend Services Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement Spring Boot microservices (user, accounts, transactions, api-gateway)
- [x] Add JWT authentication, database persistence, and OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suites with >80% code coverage

## Phase 3: Frontend Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Build Next.js frontend with TypeScript and authentication context
- [x] Implement responsive UI components for all banking operations
- [x] Integrate with backend APIs using comprehensive error handling

## Phase 4: Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Complete backend testing suite (unit, integration, API tests)
- [x] Frontend testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright E2E tests
- [x] Achieve >80% test coverage across all services

## Phase 5: Observability & Monitoring ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Deploy OpenTelemetry instrumentation across all services
- [x] Set up Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana monitoring stack
- [x] Configure distributed tracing and custom business metrics

## Phase 6: Containerization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds and security hardening
- [x] Refactor API endpoints for consistent resource-based structure
- [x] Validate containerized environment with comprehensive integration testing

## Phase 7: Kubernetes Development & Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create production-ready Kubernetes manifests with RBAC, ConfigMaps, and Secrets
- [x] Deploy and debug full stack on minikube with automated scripts
- [x] Build comprehensive E2E test client validating core authentication workflows

## Phase 8: CI/CD Pipeline & Image Registry ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions for automated building and testing
- [x] Configure Docker image registry with proper tagging and versioning
- [x] Update Kubernetes manifests to use registry images instead of local builds
- [x] The images need to be for multiple architectures arm and amd
- [x] The spring boot apps are taking a very long time like 5+ minutes to start, improve startup time

## System Architecture & Traffic Flow

### Traffic Flow Design
All external traffic flows through the frontend service, which acts as the single entry point:

```
Client → Frontend Service → API Gateway → Backend Services
```

**Architecture Principles:**
- **Frontend as Proxy**: Frontend contains Next.js API routes that proxy requests to the API Gateway
- **No Direct Backend Access**: Clients never directly access backend services or API Gateway
- **Server-Side Communication**: Backend communication uses internal Kubernetes service URLs (e.g., `http://api-gateway:8080`)
- **Relative Client URLs**: Frontend client code uses relative URLs (`/api/users/login`) that route to Next.js API handlers
- **Environment Agnostic**: No hardcoded URLs in client-side code, eliminating `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` configuration issues

**Benefits:**
- Simplified client configuration (no environment-specific URLs)
- Proper separation of concerns between client and server
- Security through single entry point
- Consistent request/response handling and logging

### Known Issues & Future Improvements
- **Frontend Pod Logging**: Implemented structured logging with custom logger but logs don't appear in `kubectl logs` output. The logging middleware and API client logging are implemented but may be getting filtered by Next.js internal routing or Edge Runtime limitations. Consider investigating:
  - Server-side API route logging vs middleware logging
  - OpenTelemetry integration for request tracing
  - Alternative logging approaches for containerized Next.js applications

## Phase 9: Production Kubernetes Deployment
- [ ] Deploy application to production Kubernetes cluster with registry images
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS, load balancing, and ingress controllers
- [ ] Set up production monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery

## Phase 10: Documentation & Security Audit
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation and developer guides
- [ ] Complete security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Finalize code quality standards and coverage analysis
- [ ] Clean up any unused scripts

## Phase 11: Advanced Features & Optimization
- [ ] Implement enhanced banking features (account types, transaction categories)
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (caching, database tuning)
- [ ] Create advanced reporting and analytics capabilities

## Phase 12: Comprehensive System Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing with complete user workflows
- [ ] Performance and load testing under concurrent usage
- [ ] Production environment validation and stress testing
