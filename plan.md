# Banking Application Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create monorepo structure with backend services, frontend, and infrastructure directories
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL with separate schemas for each microservice
- [x] Configure Docker Compose environment with logging and health checks

## Phase 2: Backend Services Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement Spring Boot microservices (user, accounts, transactions, api-gateway)
- [x] Add JWT authentication, database persistence, and initial OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suites with >80% code coverage

## Phase 3: Frontend Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Build Next.js frontend with TypeScript and authentication context
- [x] Implement responsive UI components for all banking operations
- [x] Integrate with backend APIs using comprehensive error handling

## Phase 4: Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Complete backend testing suite (unit, integration, API tests)
- [x] Frontend testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright E2E tests
- [x] Achieve >80% test coverage across all services
- [x] **API Route Testing with Proxymock**: Set up proxymock server with predefined responses for all API endpoints to enable direct testing of Next.js API routes without database dependencies

## Phase 5: Observability & Monitoring ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Deploy and configure a robust OpenTelemetry instrumentation across all services
- [x] Set up Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana monitoring stack
- [x] Configure and verify distributed tracing and custom business metrics

## Phase 6: Containerization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds and security hardening
- [x] Refactor API endpoints for consistent resource-based structure
- [x] Validate containerized environment with comprehensive integration testing

## Phase 7: Kubernetes Development & Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create production-ready Kubernetes manifests with RBAC, ConfigMaps, and Secrets
- [x] Deploy and debug full stack on minikube with automated scripts
- [x] Build comprehensive E2E test client validating core authentication workflows

## Phase 8: CI/CD Pipeline & Production Readiness ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions for automated building and testing with multi-architecture Docker images (ARM/AMD)
- [x] Configure Docker image registry with proper tagging, versioning, and optimize Spring Boot startup times
- [x] Simplify API Gateway routing architecture by eliminating complex path rewriting and implementing transparent proxy pattern

## Phase 9: Security Hardening & Architecture Review
- [x] API calls to transactions service not showing up in api-gateway logs
- [x] OTEL should be able to ignore the actuator and prometheus endpoints
- [x] **Version Management & Tagging**
    - [x] Implement semantic versioning starting with v1.1.0 for all services
    - [x] Update Docker images to use proper version tags instead of 'latest'
    - [x] Configure CI/CD pipeline to automatically tag releases
    - [x] Update Kubernetes manifests to reference specific versions
    - [x] Create version tracking documentation for all components
- [ ] **Speedscale Implementation**
    - [ ] Add DLP setting to redact the authentication
    - [ ] Record a snapshot of api-gateway traffic
    - [ ] Add in Speedscale transform to get rid of the trace context
    - [ ] Download the snapshot locally with proxymock cloud pull
    - [ ] Add a step in Makefile and GHA to run the replay in the CI pipeline
    
- [x] **API Gateway Security**: Implement proper authentication at gateway level instead of permitAll()
- [ ] **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Add authentication between microservices to prevent direct access bypass
    - [ ] **Inter-Service Identity Propagation**: Implement a mechanism to securely propagate the original user's identity (JWT) from one service to another. This is critical for operations like transaction creation where the `transactions-service` needs to call the `accounts-service` on behalf of the user.
        - [x] **Fix 401 Unauthorized Error**: Resolve the immediate authentication failure where `transactions-service` calls to `accounts-service` are rejected.
- [ ] **Security Configuration Cleanup**: Remove redundant security rules and consolidate authentication patterns
- [ ] **CORS Configuration Review**: Tighten CORS policies from allowing all origins to specific allowed origins
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting at API Gateway level to prevent abuse
- [ ] **Network Security**: Configure proper network isolation and access controls for backend services
- [ ] **JWT Security Improvements**: Implement token refresh, proper expiration handling, and secure secret management
- [ ] **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Add comprehensive input validation across all endpoints
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Implement proper security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit logging for security events

## Phase 10: Production Kubernetes Deployment
- [ ] Deploy application to production Kubernetes cluster with registry images
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS, load balancing, and ingress controllers
- [ ] Set up production monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery

## Phase 11: Documentation & Security Audit
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation and developer guides
- [ ] Complete security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Finalize code quality standards and coverage analysis
- [ ] Clean up any unused scripts

## Phase 12: Advanced Features & Optimization
- [ ] Implement enhanced banking features (account types, transaction categories)
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (caching, database tuning)
- [ ] Create advanced reporting and analytics capabilities

## Phase 13: Comprehensive System Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing with complete user workflows
- [ ] Performance and load testing under concurrent usage
- [ ] Production environment validation and stress testing
