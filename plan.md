# Banking Application Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create monorepo structure with backend services, frontend, and infrastructure directories
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL with separate schemas for each microservice
- [x] Configure Docker Compose environment with logging and health checks

## Phase 2: Backend Services Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement Spring Boot microservices (user, accounts, transactions, api-gateway)
- [x] Add JWT authentication, database persistence, and OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suites with >80% code coverage

## Phase 3: Frontend Development ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Build Next.js frontend with TypeScript and authentication context
- [x] Implement responsive UI components for all banking operations
- [x] Integrate with backend APIs using comprehensive error handling

## Phase 4: Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Complete backend testing suite (unit, integration, API tests)
- [x] Frontend testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright E2E tests
- [x] Achieve >80% test coverage across all services

## Phase 5: Observability & Monitoring ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Deploy OpenTelemetry instrumentation across all services
- [x] Set up Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana monitoring stack
- [x] Configure distributed tracing and custom business metrics

## Phase 6: Containerization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create optimized Docker images with multi-stage builds and security hardening
- [x] Refactor API endpoints for consistent resource-based structure
- [x] Validate containerized environment with comprehensive integration testing

## Phase 7: Kubernetes Development & Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create production-ready Kubernetes manifests with RBAC, ConfigMaps, and Secrets
- [x] Deploy and debug full stack on minikube with automated scripts
- [x] Build comprehensive E2E test client validating core authentication workflows

## Phase 8: Documentation & Maintenance
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation and developer guides
- [ ] Complete security audit and performance optimization
- [ ] Finalize code quality standards and coverage analysis

## Phase 9: Advanced Features & Optimization
- [ ] Implement enhanced banking features (account types, transaction categories)
- [ ] Add performance optimizations (caching, database tuning)
- [ ] Create advanced reporting and analytics capabilities

## Phase 10: Comprehensive System Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing with complete user workflows
- [ ] Performance and load testing under concurrent usage
- [ ] Security penetration testing and compliance validation

## Phase 11: Production Deployment & Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up production Kubernetes cluster with SSL/TLS and load balancing
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Configure production monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery
